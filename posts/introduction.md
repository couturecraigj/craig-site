Hello welcome to my blog and my website.  I am building this to document what I am doing and (hopefully) accomplishing.  My mindset as a developer is always to eliminate the need of returning to finished projects.  I try to utilize tools and techniques to empower others and make things maintainable from a non-development perspective.  I love developing but my thought is to always be moving and eventually make it so the company I am working for can hire me as a contractor and not need me full-time.  The more companies I can accomplish this at the more people will start recognizing this is not a common tactic for a developer and will be more likely to hire me for their contract work in the future.

Please feel free to check out my Projects and Sites to follow and like me.
