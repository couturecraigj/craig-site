## What you will find here

I have many interests so sometimes they will creep into my website but I am a developer and problem solver by day.  You will find interesting solutions to potentially frustrating problems on my site.  Unlike what many others might do, when they post regarding a tool, I am going to try to make my problems more of a day to day solution.  What usually concerns me as a developer is hard coding business logic into my tools and finding ways to avoid having to do that so that there is eventually a hope of getting all projects to a state of break-fixes only.

## What tools languages or frameworks you will find

I work in TypeScript, React/React-Native, Nodejs, Apex (Salesforce), Visualforce (Salesforce), Web Components, and Python.  My day job is focused mainly on supporting a Salesforce instance but I frequently implement bespoke React, Nodejs and other tooling to improve our user experience through our departments Server.
