    <p>
      Thanks for asking. I am a developer located in Wichita, KS. I work with a
      number of languages but mainly find myself working in Salesforce and
      JavaScript. Most of my expertise is around React, Nodejs, Apex and
      focusing on building things that will eventually not need to be managed
    </p>
